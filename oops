# polymorphism

# polymorphism in inheritance

# encapsulation

# bundling properties and methods into one single unit
# combine properties and methods into a single unit so that
# they are not accessible outside of the class

# public members(access them within and outside of the class)
# protected members(access them within the class and sub class)
# private members(access them within class itself)
